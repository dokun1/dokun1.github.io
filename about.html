<h2>Professional</h2>
<p>I am a Developer Advocate who currently works for IBM in Austin, Texas, originally born in Houston. I have been primarily focused on iOS mobile software, but I am grateful to learn about web technology more recently, such as Node.js.</p>

<p>My favorite thing to do is to teach. I firmly believe that the best teaching moments are the ones where you learn the most where you previously knew very little. I try very hard to take what I learn, and post it on <a href="https://github.com/dokun1">GitHub</a>, but I think there is more value in being able to explain how something works and walk someone through it.</p>

<h2>Travel </h2>

<p>
I've been very fortunate to see a lot of the world in my personal and professional life. At the end of 2016, I moved back to the USA from London, UK, where I lived for several years. Some other places that I've also been lucky enough to visit are:
<ul>
    <li>Florence</li>
    <li>Singapore</li>
    <li>Dubrovnik</li>
    <li>Paris</li>
    <li>Bogota</li>
    <li>Istanbul</li>
    <li>Kaunas</li>
    <li>Johannesburg</li>
</ul>

I <i>try</i> to take good photos on my Instagram <a href="https://instagram.com/dokun1">here</a> whenever I go somewhere, so feel free to take a look.

<h2>Music </h2>

<p>I've been playing music ever since I was in the 4th grade. Fun fact: The first instrument I ever learned how to play was the chanter, which is integral to the bagpipes. I also know how to play drums, guitar, bass, a little keyboard, and I pretend to be able to sing whenever karaoke is involved. I was even a DJ at a nightclub in Houston back in 2012.</p>
