<h2>Professional</h2>
<p>I am a Developer Advocate who currently works for IBM in Austin, Texas. I was originally born in Houston. Houston is the best city in Texas. Austin is great and I love living here.</p>
<p>My favorite kind of software development is on iOS. I love working with cameras, and so I've also done a lot of work with Computer Vision as a result.</p>
<p>I've also focused on REST APIs lately, so I do a lot of work with the Swift@IBM team in the UK. I'm learning a lot all the time about how to deploy them and work with them in all sorts of different languages!</p>

<h2>Travel </h2>

<p>
I've been very fortunate to see a lot of the world in my personal and professional life. At the end of 2016, I moved back to the USA from London, UK, where I lived for several years. Some other places that I've also been lucky enough to visit are:
<ul>
    <li>Florence</li>
    <li>Singapore</li>
    <li>Dubrovnik</li>
    <li>Paris</li>
    <li>Bogota</li>
    <li>Istanbul</li>
    <li>Hyderabad</li>
    <li>Kaunas</li>
    <li>Johannesburg</li>
    <li>Sa√µ Paulo</li>
    <li>Tokyo</li>
</ul>

I <i>try</i> to take good photos on my Instagram <a href="https://instagram.com/dokun1">here</a> whenever I go somewhere, so feel free to take a look.

<h2>Music </h2>

<p>I've been playing music ever since I was in the 4th grade. Fun fact: The first instrument I ever learned how to play was the chanter, which is integral to the bagpipes. I also know how to play drums, guitar, bass, a little keyboard, and I pretend to be able to sing whenever karaoke is involved. I was even a DJ at a nightclub in Houston back in 2012.</p>
<p>I do have a Soundcloud that I haven't posted to in 6 years. I won't tell you the link.</p>
