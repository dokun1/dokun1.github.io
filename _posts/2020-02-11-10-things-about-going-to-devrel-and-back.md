My interview process with IBM, from start to finish, lasted 3 months. I originally interviewed for an engineering position on the Swift team at IBM, and I would have focused on Kitura. The team was, unfortunately, unable to find room for me, and I was told to call back in 1 - 6 months. 

After 3 more weeks, I got a call asking if I would be interested in joining the Strongloop team advocating for Loopback, which is a Node.js server-generation framework, but as an evangelist for Swift developers. I mean...sure. I can't say I didn't hesitate before taking the role, and it was for two reasons.

1. I'd played with Node, but not to the point that I was about to go talk to developers about how awesome it was as though I'd been using it forever.
2. What even is a Developer Evangelist?

With that, I'd like to announce that I am leaving my position as team lead for the Client Developer Advocacy team at IBM.

Starting on the 18th of February, I'll be the new iOS Technical Director of Charles Schwab in Austin, TX!
