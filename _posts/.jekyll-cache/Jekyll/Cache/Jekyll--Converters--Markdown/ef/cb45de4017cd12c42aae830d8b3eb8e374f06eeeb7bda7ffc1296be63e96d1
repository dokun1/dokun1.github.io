<p>Everyone’s got a take on Kobe. Here’s mine</p>

<hr />

<p>I always was, and likely always be, terrible at basketball. I grew up in Houston, Texas idolizing Hakeem Olajuwon and watching him win in 1994 and 1995 the first two years I ever watched Basketball. Then Michael Jordan came back, ripped off three straight, and made me feel human as a sports fan.</p>

<p>I remember watching Kobe when he came into the league, and then I remember the first time I <em>remember</em> Kobe.</p>

<p>I remember listening to the news on the radio with my mom as she was driving me to school in 7th grade. Kobe was apologizing for his extra-marital sexual encounter. I remember watching the video later, but I remember him speaking everything he said in that moment.</p>

<p>I remember him saying how, even though he thought it was consensual, he knew it wasn’t perceived that way, and that he was truly sorry.</p>

<p>I remember seeing the video later. I remember him sitting there with nothing hiding him, owning up to his fairly large mistake, next to his wife, and taking responsibility for what he did.</p>

<p>I think Kobe knew he was an entertainer in that moment, but I think he also knew he was a role model, and I think he</p>

<p>It’s overtime against the Suns in the playoffs. He gets the tip, dribbles past the key. 1 second to go. He throws it up over two defenders, and there’s just no way it’s going in until you remember who shot it.</p>
