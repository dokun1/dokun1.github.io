I"„<p>Finally!!!</p>

<p>Tech debt is one thing, but when it‚Äôs something you care personally about, it‚Äôs insidious at worst. I‚Äôve not been doing a good job keeping this here web log updated, but I finally had some time (and some help!) to do it this weekend while at an event in San Francisco, and I‚Äôm thrilled I automated some things.</p>

<h2 id="thank-yous">Thank Yous</h2>

<p>I really need to give major props to <a href="https://twitter.com/emckean">Erin McKean</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/timroexp">Tim Robinson</a> for helping me get over the hump. Their tremendous calmness and poise helped me get out from behind the 8-ball, and helped me serve as the basis for this post, as well as what I am hoping will be more material in the future!!</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>

<p>I use <a href="https://hostgator.com">HostGator</a> for my web hosting, and while I work for <a href="https://www.ibm.com">TEH CL0UD</a> and could probably do something different, I‚Äôm stuck in my ways here. About a year ago, I finally got used to using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> for my website, and for the most part it‚Äôs been working great. I‚Äôve never been a <em>huge</em> fan of Ruby, but this definitely gets the job done.</p>

<p>You can always see a local mirror of this website <a href="https://dokun1.github.io">here</a> as well as the repo for this site <a href="https://github.com/dokun1/dokun1.github.io">here</a>, but I wanted it on my actual domain, and I wanted to not limit myself to a GitHub page. That meant I was building my site with Jekyll on my machine‚Ä¶and manually FTP‚Äôing the generated site to my host via Cyberduck‚Ä¶</p>

</p>

<p>Furthermore, I had some issue with Jekyll that made things look UGLY unless I manually went in and changed things to remove a fledgling comment line. I‚Äôm not even going to post a photo of it here, because the sooner I can forget about it, the better.</p>

<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>

<p>Well, Erin was gracious enough to sit with me and point out where the bug was coming from. Sometimes, you feel dumb when you see a solution to a bug you <strong>should</strong> have fixed 7 months ago, but I was so overjoyed fixing this that I didn‚Äôt care. Still, the process of updating the blog was a pain, and I had to automate it.</p>

<p>Erin suggested a Travis CI job that uploads it for me. Truthfully, she suggested triggering an OpenWhisk action every time I committed a change to my blog, and using that to upload it to my host. ‚ÄúThat would be more bloggable.‚Äù One day!</p>

<p>First off, <code class="highlighter-rouge">curl</code> and FTP. I tried uploading one file with <code class="highlighter-rouge">curl</code>:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>curl <span class="nt">-T</span> file.jpg ftp://ftp.okun.io <span class="nt">--user</span> <span class="nv">$username</span>:<span class="nv">$password</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This works for one file. Want to upload a directory? Too bad. Time to furiously Google things and try them, being able to taste sweet victory not far off.</p>

<p>I tried some things with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">find</code> command, but largely proved unsuccessful. Then I asked <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51575574/curl-ftp-for-directory-containing-files-and-directories#51581328">a question</a> on StackOverflow, and that‚Äôs where Tim came in. I tried his command on the CLI:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>find _site <span class="nt">-type</span> f <span class="nt">-exec</span> curl <span class="nt">--user</span> <span class="nv">$username</span>:<span class="nv">$password</span> <span class="nt">--ftp-create-dirs</span> <span class="nt">-T</span> <span class="o">{}</span> ftp://ftp.okun.io/<span class="o">{}</span> <span class="se">\;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I can taste it! So I wrote this into a script on Travis CI, and the file ultimately looked like this:</p>

<div class="language-yml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">script</span><span class="pi">:</span> 
  <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s">bundle install</span>
  <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s">gem install jekyll</span>
  <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s">find _site -type f -exec curl --user $FTPUSERNAME:$FTPPASSWORD --ftp-create-dirs -T {} ftp://ftp.okun.io/{} \;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Aaaaaaand‚Ä¶nope. Code 430 errors all around - access denied. Panic. I was so close!!! But then I took a breath, and read a blog post that Tim sent me (which you can read <a href="http://ajaykarwal.com/deploying-jekyll-using-travis-ci/">here</a>).</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre reading this, you now know that more than half of all software development is just being really good at searching for things on search engines.</p>

<p>A little bit more work, and ultimately my <code class="highlighter-rouge">.travis.yml</code> file looks like this now:</p>

<div class="language-yml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">language</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">ruby</span>
<span class="na">rvm</span><span class="pi">:</span>

  <span class="na">global</span><span class="pi">:</span>

    <span class="na">on_failure</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">always</span>

<span class="na">script</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s">chmod +x _scripts/build.sh</span>
  <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s">_scripts/build.sh</span>

<span class="na">after_success</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s">chmod +x _scripts/deploy.sh</span>
  <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s">_scripts/deploy.sh</span>

    <span class="na">packages</span><span class="pi">:</span>
      <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s">ncftp</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And that deploy script? Two lines:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cd </span>_site <span class="o">||</span> <span class="nb">exit
</span>ncftpput <span class="nt">-R</span> <span class="nt">-v</span> <span class="nt">-u</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$FTPUSERNAME</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="nt">-p</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$FTPPASSWORD</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="s2">"ftp.okun.io"</span> ./ <span class="nb">.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, all I have to do is commit to my repo - Travis CI does the rest, and things get updated in about a minute.</p>

<p>Whew! Now I have more to say here. Again, thank you Erin and Tim for your help/rubber-ducking/calmness.</p>
