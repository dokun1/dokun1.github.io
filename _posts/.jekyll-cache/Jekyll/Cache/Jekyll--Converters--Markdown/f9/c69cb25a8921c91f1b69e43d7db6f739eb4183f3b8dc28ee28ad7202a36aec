<p>Mobile developers often work with REST APIs or other networking protocols in their applications ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs to retrieve data, communicate with other devices, or something else. <em><a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SwiftNIO</a></em>, written by Apple, is a low-level networking framework that makes writing Swift servers even easier than before, empowering Swift developers to leverage their skills on the server side.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you‚Äôll:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learn about what purpose SwiftNIO serves and why Apple made and open-sourced it.</li>
  <li>Practice working within a SwiftNIO framework by creating a <em>Quote Of The Day</em> Swift TCP server that you‚Äôll connect to using a provided iOS app.</li>
</ul>

<p>To start, you‚Äôll need a Mac running at least macOS 10.12 Sierra with Xcode 9.3 or later. You‚Äôll also use the command line, so be sure to open up Terminal, and check the command line utility for Swift is installed. You can check this by entering <code class="highlighter-rouge">swift --version</code>. It must be version 4.1 or later.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: The command line tool you need should be installed with Xcode. If you don‚Äôt successfully see your version of Swift when running the <code class="highlighter-rouge">swift --version</code> command, go <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/technotes/tn2339/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40014588-CH1-DOWNLOADING_COMMAND_LINE_TOOLS_IS_NOT_AVAILABLE_IN_XCODE_FOR_MACOS_10_9__HOW_CAN_I_INSTALL_THEM_ON_MY_MACHINE_" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a> for more information.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>First, it‚Äôs helpful to understand exactly how the SwiftNIO framework differs from other Swift frameworks.</p>

<h3 id="swift-on-the-server-status-quo">Swift-on-the-Server Status Quo</h3>

<p>If you‚Äôre a Swift developer, it‚Äôs very likely you‚Äôve focused only on mobile applications. This makes servers in the cloud seem like voodoo magic ‚Äî or at least a little confusing at first.</p>

<p align="center">

</p>

<p>Thankfully, if you know Swift, frameworks like <a href="http://kitura.io" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kitura</a> and <a href="https://vapor.codes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Vapor</a> make writing a web service easier.</p>

<p>However, these frameworks operate as a convenient layer on top of some sophisticated and low-level socket networking code, much of which interoperates with C. In the case of Kitura, once Swift became open sourced and available for Linux, IBM wrote <em><a href="https://github.com/IBM-Swift/BlueSocket" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BlueSocket</a></em> to serve as its low-level socket networking layer.</p>

<h3 id="how-swiftnio-differs">How SwiftNIO Differs</h3>

<p align="center">
	<img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/cloudHappy-500x500.jpg" alt="SwiftNIO" width="300" class="size-large wp-image-188664" />You complete me, NIO.
</p>

<p>BlueSocket is great, but it doesn‚Äôt fill in all the blanks when it comes to server-side Swift. For example, Kitura not only included the work of BlueSocket, but it also implemented the entire HTTP stack under the hood, so incoming communication would be routed the right way. Now, Apple has raised the bar, introducing <em>SwiftNIO</em> and essentially handling socket communication and HTTP for us.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: SwiftNIO has been written as a port of <a href="https://netty.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Netty</a>, a Java low-level networking framework, but in Swift.</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/normansDiagram-650x358.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="358" class="size-large wp-image-188746" /> This is a diagram taken from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ3WG9kRLMo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Norman Maurer's talk</a> on SwiftNIO, given March 1, 2018, in Tokyo.
</p>

<p>This tutorial won‚Äôt go into great detail about every piece of the above diagram but, as you work your way through, each piece should begin to make sense. However, it‚Äôs worth explaining what an <code>EventLoopGroup</code> is and, thus, what a <code>MultiThreadedEventLoopGroup</code> accomplishes with this class.</p>

<h3 id="eventloopgroup-and-multithreadedeventloopgroup">EventLoopGroup and MultiThreadedEventLoopGroup</h3>

<p>An <code>EventLoop</code> runs in a loop, looking for new tasks to handle that have come in from a new client via a network connection. Think of an <code>EventLoop</code> like a serial <code>DispatchQueue</code>, which allows you to delegate blocks of code for execution at a time of your choosing. As multiple <code>EventLoop</code> instances cycle through your thread, they look for tasks to execute.</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/runLoop-1.png" alt="" width="650" height="240" class="size-full wp-image-189249" />After an EventLoop searches for tasks and schedules them, it executes them one by one.
</p>

<p>When you put these <code>EventLoop</code> instances into an <code>EventLoopGroup</code>, the handler looks more like a concurrent <code>DispatchQueue</code>. You can also think of this like a thread pool. This means you can submit multiple tasks to the group and, depending on the time it takes to complete each task, the order of completed tasks may not be what you initially submitted to the group.</p>

<p>This is where the <code>MultiThreadedEventLoopGroup</code> class comes in. This specifies the <code>EventLoopGroup</code> that‚Äôs created will tie each group to a specific thread, further streamlining your asynchronous operations that come in. Think of it like an upgraded <code>EventLoopGroup</code>.</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/runLoopGroup.png" alt="" width="650" height="416" class="size-full wp-image-189251" />Each task gets taken care of in its own discrete group.
</p>

<h3 id="synchronousasynchronous-example">Synchronous/Asynchronous Example</h3>

<p>Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre at a food truck operated by one person. The person at the front of the line orders his food. He pays; he waits. He gets his food. The next person repeats this same process. The food truck delivers everyone‚Äôs order correctly, but it‚Äôs very slow. If you‚Äôre at the end of the line, you are pretty unhappy.</p>

<p>This is an example of a synchronous operation ‚Äî something that blocks all other work until the current request is completed. A connection to a PostgreSQL database is another example.</p>

<p>Now, imagine the same food truck has an order-taker <em>and</em> two chefs. The person at the front of the line orders his food.  He pays; he waits. But wait! The second person can now order his food without having to wait for the operator to complete the order for the first person. And the first person only has to wait for one other person. Here, the chefs are the EventLoopGroups making the food.</p>

<p>This is an example of a set of asynchronous operations. Ultimately, you‚Äôre waiting on the available resources of the service. But this new setup can handle multiple requests at the same time. The end user will see an increase in performance.</p>

<p>Another example of this is‚Ä¶ well, SwiftNIO!</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-quote-of-the-day">Setting Up Quote of the Day</h2>

<p>To kick things off, download the materials for this tutorial; you can find a link at the top or bottom of this tutorial. You‚Äôll be implementing a server called <em>Quote of the Day</em> ‚Äî believe it or not, <em>Quote of the Day (QOTD)</em> is a real internet standard (RFC). You can read the protocol spec <em><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc865" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a></em>.</p>

<p>The flow of information from the server works as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Open a TCP connection upon request.</li>
  <li>Write a random quote to the response.</li>
  <li>Send the response.</li>
  <li>Close the connection.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you take a look at the RFC for <em>Quote of the Day</em>, you‚Äôll notice two key things that you‚Äôll do differently in this tutorial:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You‚Äôll use port 1717 instead of 17. Port 17 is locked down, requiring root permissions on macOS.</li>
  <li>You‚Äôll only create a TCP/IP connection, not a UDP connection. As of this writing, UDP is still a WIP on SwiftNIO (so many acronyms!).</li>
</ul>

<p>For this tutorial, you‚Äôll also use an iOS client to check that the server works properly. This iOS client uses <em><a href="https://github.com/IBM-Swift/BlueSocket" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BlueSocket</a></em> ‚Äî you won‚Äôt be making any changes to the iOS app, but feel free to look through the source code on your own.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: SwiftNIO also has the ability to act as a client for network communication and not just as a server. This means you could, in theory, write an iOS client using SwiftNIO, too.</p>

<h2 id="running-the-ios-client">Running the iOS Client</h2>

<p>In the starter project, go to the <code>Mobile/</code> directory and open up the <code>swift-nio-qotd-client.xcodeproj</code> file. In Xcode, run this on a simulator of your choosing. However, don‚Äôt run this on a device, as you won‚Äôt easily be able to connect with a local server connection on your machine from your device.</p>

<p>When the simulator boots up, tap the refresh icon in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. You should see the following error underneath the <em>Quote</em> heading:</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/Swift-NIO-error-281x500.png" alt="" width="281" height="500" class="aligncenter size-large bordered wp-image-189185" />Fear not! This is normal.
</p>

<p>Keep this simulator open, but minimize it on your machine. You‚Äôll come back to this later when you get your server up and running.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-your-server-project">Setting Up Your Server Project</h2>

<p>Open Terminal and navigate to the root directory of the starter project. Enter the following commands:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cd </span>Server/
swift build
swift package generate-xcodeproj
open QOTD-NIO.xcodeproj
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you have <em>MacPorts</em> installed on your machine you may have to use the following in place of <code>swift build</code> above: <code>rm -rf .build &amp;&amp; unset PKG_CONFIG_PATH &amp;&amp; swift build</code></p>

<p>Once Xcode opens, go to the top of the window and, in the scheme selector, select <code>QOTD-NIO</code> and <code>My Mac</code> like so:</p>

<p><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/schemeSelectorStarter.jpg" alt="" class="bordered aligncenter size-full" /></p>

<p>Build and run the project. At the bottom of the debugger, you should see a single printed message: <em>This server will be‚Ä¶ the one!!!</em> If you see this, you‚Äôre ready to dive in.</p>

<h2 id="bootstrapping-a-server">Bootstrapping a Server</h2>

<p>In Xcode, open <em>QuoteServer.swift</em>. This is where you‚Äôre going to set up your server to bind to a port.</p>

<p>Replace the code in this file with the following:</p>

<div class="language-swift highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">import</span> <span class="kt">Foundation</span>

  <span class="p">}</span> 
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What this code is doing:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You import the NIO module in this class ‚Äî you won‚Äôt get far without it!</li>
  <li>You specify a <code>MultiThreadedEventLoopGroup</code> when you run your server, as you learned earlier. You can run as many threads as your system will allow you here ‚Äî use the <code>System</code> API for this.</li>
  <li>You set the host and port the server will listen on. You could perform validation logic on your host and port here, if needed.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, you‚Äôll add a private variable for an object that you need called a <code>ServerBootstrap</code>. Think of this class as a helper class that sets up a server for you to serve information that you delegate. Inside your class declaration, but below <code>init(host:port:)</code>, add this:</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Looking at the code above:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You assign the bootstrap a <code>MultiThreadedEventLoopGroup</code> ‚Äî it needs to know which run loops to utilize on your machine.</li>
  <li>You specify you want your channel ‚Äî or your communication pipe ‚Äî to connect with a networking socket available on your machine and to reuse the local address on your machine (REUSEADDR).</li>
  <li>Once communications come through the bootstrap, the channels that are the children of this bootstrap also need work to do ‚Äî the <code>BackPressureHandler()</code> basically ensures that reading a new request only happens as fast as the server is writing a response.</li>
  <li>You then specify that you want to write your own custom class to handle incoming communication from the outside world ‚Äî you‚Äôll work on this class shortly.</li>
  <li>Finally, you specify that your server will operate on TCP and that you won‚Äôt delay the sending of any packets of information as a response.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: In the code block above, the explanation covers only the options that directly affect this tutorial. However, to learn more about the others, refer to the official <a href="https://apple.github.io/swift-nio/docs/current/NIO/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Apple SwiftNIO Docs</a></p>

<p>Build and run your project. You should see the same result as before. You still have a few more steps to complete your working QOTD server.</p>

<h2 id="handling-incoming-requests-with-channelinboundhandler">Handling Incoming Requests With ChannelInboundHandler</h2>

<p>In Xcode, open <em>QuoteHandler.swift</em>. Notice you already have a stubbed class that conforms to <code>ChannelInboundHandler</code>. This protocol gives you access to a series of methods that handle communication with the associated <code>ServerBootstrap</code> you set up. You‚Äôll implement two of these shortly.</p>

<p>Notice the following two lines are already in the class:</p>

<div class="language-swift highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">typealias</span> <span class="kt">InboundIn</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kt">ByteBuffer</span>
<span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">typealias</span> <span class="kt">OutboundOut</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kt">ByteBuffer</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These are convenience typealiases that are required to declare to conform to <code>ChannelInboundHandler</code> so you can specify what kind of data comes into and out of your handler. You‚Äôre using <code>ByteBuffer</code>, which stores contiguously allocated raw bytes of data. This is straight-forward to work with when you‚Äôre writing a <code>String</code> to your response, as you‚Äôll soon see.</p>

<p>Inside your class and underneath your <code>typealias</code> declarations, add the following:</p>

<div class="language-swift highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// 1</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let‚Äôs take a look at what you‚Äôve just added:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>channelRegistered</code> is one of the methods in <code>ChannelInboundHandler</code>. Since you want to send a quote as a response when a connection is a requested, this method is quite convenient.</li>
  <li>You get a random quote from <code>QuoteGenerator</code>, a class that‚Äôs been provided for you that selects a quote from an array of them. Feel free to add any others you like.</li>
  <li>You get a handle for your response byte buffer from the incoming channel (communication pipe).</li>
  <li>You write your quote, which is a <code>string</code>, to the response buffer.</li>
  <li>Now that you‚Äôve written to your buffer, you need to write the buffer to the channel, and then flush the communication pipe. Whatever you flush down the pipe is going to come out the other end, but this doesn‚Äôt guarantee the next line of code you write will wait for that to finish. This is where <code>.whenComplete</code> comes in.</li>
  <li>Inside your handler for <code>.whenComplete</code>, you‚Äôre establishing what you want to do when the previous operation is complete. In this case, to follow the requirements of the QOTD protocol, you close the channel connection.</li>
  <li>You also implement another method in <code>ChannelInboundHandler</code> for handling ‚Äî you guessed it ‚Äî errors! Notice you actually get a handy-dandy, Swifty <code>Error</code> type instead of something in C!</li>
</ol>

<p>From this example, you can see that, anytime you want to handle incoming information from a client, you need to write a handler that conforms to <code>ChannelInboundHandler</code> to do so. From here, the possibilities are endless.</p>

<p>In Xcode, go back to <code>QuoteServer.swift</code> and, in between your <code>init(host:port:)</code> method and your <code>serverBootstrap</code> var, add the following:</p>

<div class="language-swift highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// 1</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Breaking down what you‚Äôve done:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You don‚Äôt want to put this code inside <code>init(host:port:)</code> method because it‚Äôs not ideal to let code that runs ‚Äúforever‚Äù reside in a constructor. This makes it easy to debug issues, too.</li>
  <li>You check for port and host using two guard statements.</li>
  <li>With values for host and port ensured, you bind the <code>ServerBootstrap</code> instance you create in this class to a host and port that you specify. Calling <code>wait()</code> at the end of this means you‚Äôre waiting for the ‚Äúpromise‚Äù to be fulfilled. This means you‚Äôre waiting for your server to start.</li>
</ol>

<p>Poetic as it sounds, you can‚Äôt run forever; you need a graceful way to shut down your server. In the same class, after <code>run()</code>, add the following:</p>

<div class="language-swift highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nf">shutdown</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">do</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// 1</span>
    <span class="k">try</span> <span class="n">group</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">syncShutdownGracefully</span><span class="p">()</span>
  <span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">catch</span> <span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">error</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Could not shutdown gracefully - forcing exit (</span><span class="se">\(</span><span class="n">error</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">localizedDescription</span><span class="se">)</span><span class="s">)"</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="c1">// 2</span>
    <span class="nf">exit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Server closed"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôve just added:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You try the friendly API for the <code>MultiThreadedEventLoopGroup</code> for shutting down without causing any issues. This means it‚Äôll wrap up any last tasks it might have to execute, and then it shuts itself down.</li>
  <li>Of course, if that just won‚Äôt fly, you hit the power button yourself and shut down the server ‚Äúun-gracefully.‚Äù</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="running-your-server">Running Your Server</h2>

<p>You‚Äôve got yourself a server! Only one more change before we run it.</p>

<p>In Xcode, open <em>main.swift</em>. Delete the lone print statement at the bottom and replace it with the following:</p>

<div class="language-swift highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// 1</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">server</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kt">QuoteServer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">host</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">"localhost"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">port</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">1717</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">do</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="c1">// 2</span>
  <span class="k">try</span> <span class="n">server</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">run</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">catch</span> <span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">error</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Error: </span><span class="se">\(</span><span class="n">error</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">localizedDescription</span><span class="se">)</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="c1">// 3</span>
  <span class="n">server</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">shutdown</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And here‚Äôs what this code does:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You create an instance of your <code>server</code>, passing host and port.</li>
  <li>You run your server. Note, if this call works successfully, which it should, then the application will run infinitely until you shut it down or until something breaks.</li>
  <li>You check for any errors and, if you detect any, you make use of your handy-dandy <code>shutdown()</code> method.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Remember you might not want to start your server from inside the constructor? The above code is a great example of this. A separate <code>run()</code> method allows us to make changes to other properties of your server before running it.</p>

<p>Build and run your project. You should see a line in the debugger about your server being open on port 1717.</p>

<p>Pull your iOS client back up. Build and run it if you stopped the project. Tap the refresh button and‚Ä¶</p>

<p>You can download the final project using the link at the top or bottom of this tutorial. I encourage you to build on this and play with the available APIs to see what else you can do.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you clone the <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-nio" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SwiftNIO</a> project from source, there are a couple of demos you can try right inside the project itself. If you open Xcode, you can see the executables listed in the scheme selector:</p>
