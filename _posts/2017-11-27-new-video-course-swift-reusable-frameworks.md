For the past few months, I've been putting together a video course on how to write Swift code in a truly unique way - a reusable framework.

Having worked on a few SDKs before, I love thinking about working on things in a reusable way, and being able to ship frameworks and developer tools is a lot of fun. Here's a preview video for the course:

This project-based training course shows how to build a camera library that you can drag and drop into any iOS app.">Swift: Writing Reusable Frameworks</a></strong> by <a href="https://www.lynda.com/author/10597777">David Okun</a></div>
</p>

The course is very heavily based on the work I've done with [Lumina](https://github.com/dokun1/lumina) so far, and I hope these principles encourage you to try and write your own framework as well!!

The course is behind a paywall, but I can definitely vouch for the quality of other courses on [Lynda](https://lynda.com), which is now LinkedIn Learning. Give it a shot, and let me know if you enjoy the course!!
